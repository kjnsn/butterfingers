# 🍌 Butterfingers

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kjnsn/butterfingers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kjnsn/butterfingers)

Butterfingers connects to a HTTP server, sends a request, and will immediately close
the connection before the response is received.

Note: there was no butter emoji, so a banana (a common slippery food) was used instead.
